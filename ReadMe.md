# Teegarden Solar System
## Basic Information 
The Teegarden solar system is one of the few solar systems found near Earth and Sol that hold the potential to house a habitaible planet. We consider habitable planets any planet capabale of sustaining life on Earth. Scientists generally understand that life can come about on planets uninhabitable or outright hostile to human life, but consider the search for these kinds of planets fruitless and a waste of time as we have no baseline or examples of what these planest could or should look like. The Teegarden solar system lies 12 lighyears away from Earth with two known planets orbiting the parent star. 
### Teegarden (Star)
Teegarden was discovered in 2003 using asteroid tracking data from that year collected from telescopes in Maui. Teegarden is a red dwraf, meaning it is quite small, dim, and not very hot. Due to its dimmness, it was nearly overlooked when the steroid data we originally collected, as its lack of light makes red dwarves difficult to detect with traditional telescopes.
